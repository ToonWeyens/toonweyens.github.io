> My story started with the study of energy engineering in multiple countries. This taught me how to act like an engineer. 

> Afterwards, I took a deep dive into the physics of nuclear fusion, the most promising source of energy for the future. This taught me how to think like a scientist. It also resulted in a Ph.D. degree, and a postdoctoral Monaco Fellowship to perform research at the outstanding ITER Organization. 

> To satisfy my inner mathematician, without losing sight of what drives me, I finally redirected my career towards Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. This taught me how to integrate, communicate and operate like a project manager. 

> Until recently I enjoyed applying my cross-domain knowledge and competencies at DataRobot, that we are building into the world's leading AI company.

> Now it is time for a new challenge.
