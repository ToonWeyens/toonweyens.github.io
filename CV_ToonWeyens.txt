  Adding value to society with technology is what drives me. My journey
  started with the study of energy engineering in multiple countries.
  This taught me how to act like an engineer. Afterwards, I took a deep
  dive into the physics of nuclear fusion, the most promising source of
  energy for the future. This taught me how to think like a scientist.
  It also resulted in a Ph.D. degree, and a postdoctoral Monaco
  Fellowship to perform research at the outstanding ITER Organization.
  To satisfy my inner mathematician, without losing sight of what drives
  me, I finally redirected my career towards Data Science and Artificial
  Intelligence. This taught me how to integrate, communicate and operate
  like a project manager. I now enjoy applying my cross-domain knowledge
  and competencies at MathWorks, a company that operates between
  industry and academia, and whose vision I am thoroughly aligned with.
  At MathWorks, I have the privilege to guide and educate our partners
  so that they can make the best possible use of our toolset, enabling
  them to get their projects from idea to application in the most
  efficient way with the lowest risk.
