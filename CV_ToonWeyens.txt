  ▼ My story started with the study of energy engineering in multiple
  countries. This taught me how to act like an engineer.

  Afterwards, I took a deep dive into the physics of nuclear fusion, the
  most promising source of energy for the future. This taught me how to
  think like a scientist. It also resulted in a Ph.D. degree, and a
  postdoctoral Monaco Fellowship to perform research at the outstanding
  ITER Organization.

  To satisfy my inner mathematician, without losing sight of what drives
  me, I finally redirected my career towards Data Science and Artificial
  Intelligence. This taught me how to integrate, communicate and operate
  like a project manager.

  I now enjoy applying my cross-domain knowledge and competencies at
  DataRobot that we are building into world’s leading AI company.
