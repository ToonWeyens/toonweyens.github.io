# curriculum vitae

* Based on [moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk) by Abhinav Saxena.
* Modified to fit my needs and embellished.

## To use:

* Update the `.md` files and do a `git push`
* To test you can run `bundle exec jekyll server`
* Note that blog posts live under `_posts` and that they have a naming convention which will be parsed on the website
